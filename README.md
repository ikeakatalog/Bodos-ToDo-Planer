# Bodo's ToDo Planer

Welcome to Bodo's ToDo Planer, a powerful yet intuitive tool for managing complex projects and tasks. The core concept revolves around a **hierarchical, nested task structure**, allowing you to break down large projects into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, which can themselves be broken down further.

This is a purely client-side application with no build process. All data is stored locally in your browser.

## ‚ú® Features (MVP)

-   **Infinite Nesting:** Create jobs within jobs to any depth.
-   **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete any task or sub-task.
-   **Collapsible Tree View:** Easily navigate your entire task hierarchy.
-   **Detailed Task Information:** Each task includes fields for a name, briefing, general info, links, and creator.
-   **Status Tracking:** Assign one of four statuses: `Proposed`, `In Progress`, `On Hold`, or `Done`.
-   **Time Tracking:** Each task has an independent timer to track time spent.
-   **Persistent State:** Your task list is automatically saved to your browser's local storage.
